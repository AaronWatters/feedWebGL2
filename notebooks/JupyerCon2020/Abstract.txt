Using WebGL2 Transform Feedback in Jupiter Widgets for advanced computations and graphics

Aaron Watters

Hello, my name is Aaron Watters and I am a 
Senior software engineer with the Flatiron Institute of the 
Simons Foundation in New York City.

This talk describes how WebGL2 makes it possible to use
The GPU of a standard computer to do highly parallel computations.
By making use a of a feature called Transform/Feedback
A programmer can capture outputs from a GPU computation
And either send them into additional GPU processing stages
Or extract the data for other general uses.

The talk also describes support libraries I built which simplify
The process of building transform/feedback processing stages
And how transform/feedback stages can be created and controlled
From within a Jupiter notebook

The talk describes the implementation of the marching tetrahedra
Method for generating 3 dimensional isosurfaces from dense arrays
As a concrete example usage of transform/feedback.
The marching tetrahedra method is implemented in two stages which
Feed directly into the standard three.js rendering pipline.
